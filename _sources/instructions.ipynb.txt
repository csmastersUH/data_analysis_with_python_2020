    "* You will see a new `TMC` tab in  the left section of VS Code.\n",

    "* Follow the instructions on the following page to install TMC client \n",
    "    https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-cli\n",
    "* For this approach especially, you need to know the basics of command line use in the terminal/command prompt\n",
    "* Go to a folder where you want to download the exercises, and issue command `tmc login`\n",
    "* If it asks for a server address, then your TMC client is outdated. Re-install the client.\n",
