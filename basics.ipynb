All the data that is stored on disks or transmitted across the internet are sequences of bytes. Normally we don't have to care about bytes, since our strings and other variables are automatically converted to a sequence of bytes when needed to. An example of the correspondence between the usual data types and bytes is the characters in a string. A single character is encoded as a sequence of one or more bytes. For example, in the common [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoding the character `c` corresponds to the byte with integer value 99 and the character `ä` corresponds to sequence of bytes [195, 164].

    "* We have learned that Python's code blocks are denoted by consistent indenting, with spaces or tabs, unlike in many other languages\n",
    "* Python's `for` loops goes through all the elements of a container without the need of worrying about the positions (indices) of the elements in the container\n",
    "* More generally, an iterable is an object whose elements can be gone through one by one using a `for` loop. Such as `range(1,7)`\n",
    "* Python has dynamic typing: the type of a name is known only when we run the program. The type might not be fixed, that is, if a name is created, for example, in a loop, then its type might change at each iteration.\n",
    "* Visibility of a name: a name that refers to a variable can disappear in the middle of a code block, if a `del` statement is issued!\n",
    "* Python is good at string handling, but remember that if you want to concatenate large number of strings, use the `join` method. Concatenating by the `+` operator multiple times is very inefficient\n",
    "* Several useful tools exist to process sequences: `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, `zip`, `enumerate`, and `range`. The unnamed lambda function can be helpful with these tools. Note that these tools (except the `reduce`) don't return lists, but iterables, for efficiency reasons: Most often we don't want to store the result from these tools to a container (such as a list), we may only want to iterate through the result!"
